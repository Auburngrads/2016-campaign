2016 Presidential Campaign Speeches

This repository contains a selection of campaign speeches given by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.

The selection was originally created for a text mining workshop for a history class. I began with the speeches available at the UCSB American Presidency Project (http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php), and then added further speeches from the candidates' websites and major news outlets.

As of October 20th, this collection is incomplete, but I intend to continue adding to it.
